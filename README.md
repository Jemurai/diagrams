# Diagrams

A simple repo with diagrams for understanding interesting security questions.

## A List of the Diagrams

* [Understanding Licenses](licenses.md)
* [Choosing a Security Standard](standards.md)
* [Incident Response Flow](incidentresponse.md)
* [Vendor Management Flow](vendormanagement.md)
* [Vuln Management Flow](vulnmanagement.md)

## Tricks

One thing that is cool, is that you can style the diagrams.  So you
can do something like this to apply a style to a given node:

`style elementId fill:#8e8,stroke:#ddd,stroke-width:8px;`

In this example, `elementId` is just the name of the node in the mermaid
diagram.  This is a neat way to highlight where in the flow you are currently.

See:  [https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html) for more detail.
